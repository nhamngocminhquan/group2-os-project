	 * portEND_SWITCHING_ISR is a macro used in FreeRTOS to request a context switch from 
	 * within an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) if needed. 
	 *
	 * The macro is specific to the hardware platform (port) being used and is part of 
	 * FreeRTOS's low-level scheduler support.
	 *
	 * Context Switching in ISRs:
	 *
	 * When an interrupt occurs, it can unblock a higher-priority task. If this happens, 
	 * the system needs to switch from the currently running task to the newly unblocked task.
	 *
	 * This is where portEND_SWITCHING_ISR comes in. It allows the kernel to efficiently request 
	 * a context switch if a higher-priority task is now ready to execute.
	 *
	 * Parameters:
	 *
	 *  portEND_SWITCHING_ISR usually takes one argument, a flag that indicates whether a context i
	 *  switch is needed.  
	 *
	 *  Typically, this flag is a variable like xHigherPriorityTaskWoken, which is set by FreeRTOS i
	 *  interrupt-safe API functions (e.g., xSemaphoreGiveFromISR) to pdTRUE if a higher-priority 
	 *  task was unblocked, or pdFALSE if no task change is required.
	 *
	 *  If the interrupt service routine has caused a higher-priority task to become ready to run 
	 *  (e.g., by unblocking a waiting task), xHigherPriorityTaskWoken is set to pdTRUE.
	 *
	 *  portEND_SWITCHING_ISR checks this flag, and if pdTRUE, it triggers a context switch. 
	 *  This ensures that the highest-priority ready task gets executed right after the ISR finishes.
